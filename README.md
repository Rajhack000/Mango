## How to Use

### Online Version

### Run Locally

1. Clone this repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-traffic-analyzer.git
   cd network-traffic-analyzer
   ```

2. Install dependencies

## How It Works

The analyzer works by overriding the native fetch and XMLHttpRequest APIs to intercept all network requests made within the iframe. It captures request details including:

- Request method and URL
- Headers
- Request body
- Response data and status

## Limitations

Due to browser security restrictions:
- Some requests may be blocked by CORS policies
- Requests from other origins or secure contexts may not be visible
- This tool is meant for educational and development purposes only
